/**
 * 876. Middle of the Linked List
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Description: Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.
 *
 * If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.
 *
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: [3,4,5]
 * Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
 *
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 * Output: [4,5,6]
 * Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
